# Vector field visualizer

This project allows for visualization of vector fields.

The one in the project is in the following formula.

- Vx(x,y)=x^2 - y^2 - 4
- Vy(x,y)=2xy

This formula behaves a little like a magnet, and the center of the field follows the mouse.

To build and run the project, you must install the CMake tool and have the OpenGL package available.

If you have all tools including git installed. Just run the following commands

```
git clone https://github.com/DeeMarchi/vector-field-visualizer
cd ./vector-field-visualizer
cmake -S . -B build
cd ./build
cmake --build .
```
